## Hey there 👋

### About Me
- 🎓 Final year MEng student in **Artificial Intelligence** and Computer Science graduate
- 📚 I’m currently working on my final thesis about **Federated Learning**
- 🧬 I’m currently learning **Graph Neural Networks** for path generation
- 🌄 **Nature Lover**: Hiking, Biking, and Even the Occasional Cliff Dive 🌊

### Recent Projects

1. 🛡️ **Adversarial-Learning-with-FGSM-attacks-and-OOD-Detection:** *Unveiling Vulnerabilities and Securing AI Models* 
   - Repository explores adversarial attacks and OOD detection in PyTorch with three key experiments: 1. OOD detection using "max logits." 2. FGSM attack for robust   
     training. 3. Targeted FGSM attack evaluation, detailed in README. 🎯

2. 🔍 **Going Deeper with Residual Blocks:** *Why going deeper is not always better, unless you use residual blocks*
   - Repository analyzes neural network depth with MLP and CNNs (VGG16, VGG19, VGG24) for image classification on CIFAR10, also comparing ResNet18 and ResNet34.   
     Explores behavior through gradient and parameter studies. Detailed results in README. 📊🧠📈

3. 🤹‍♂️ **Multi-Task-Attention-Network (MTAN):** *Encoder-Decoder architecture with attention for multi task learning* 
   - Unofficial implementation of 'End-To-End Multi-Task Learning with Attention' (Liu et al., 2019), achieving state-of-the-art 
     results with an Encoder-Decoder architecture and attention modules. 🏆
